This is a short and fun trivia game.  It features 8 different questions on a range of subjects, as well as a countdown timer that gives the player 60 seconds to finish the quiz.  

The game begins after pressing the button on the initial screen.  After this, the player has 60 seconds to answer all 8 questions before the time runs out and the code automatically takes the player to a results screen that displays how many questions were answered correctly, incorrectly, or went unanswered.  If the player finishes early, they can push a button at the bottom of the questions screen to end the game early.
